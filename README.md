## How is it better than juggling in real life?
* Change the difficulty - make it easier than real life. Increase the difficulty as you improve!
* Auto-launcher - never bend down to pick up a juggling ball ever again!
* Personal best recorder - never miss a new personal best as every run is timed and counted
* Trails - See the paths to help you learn new tricks
* Ball resizing - have your favourite size, from ping pong balls to basketballs, all for free!
* Ball recolouring - easier ball tracking with your own colour combinations
* Distraction free - have a perfect background and lighting!
* No height requirement - juggling in any room, even with a low ceiling!
* Advanced mode - just juggle and the simulator will work out your juggling pattern and record your personal best for that siteswap
